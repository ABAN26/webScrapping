# Welcome to Web Scraping for Data Science on Coursera
In the course we extract public data from SpaceX present on a web page
## Getting Started 
You will need to install yfinance if you are working with Anaconda
""" !pip install yfinance """

 """ !pip install bs4
!pip install nbformat """

Install the libraries required to extract and display data

#### How is the source code different from the course code?
- At work I am solving the exercises and watching the execution with you
- We explore the resulting values
